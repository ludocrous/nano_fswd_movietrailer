Movie Trailer Website
#####################

This project is part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

Overview:
This program creates an html page containing a list of favourite movies using their id's from the The Movie DB
(https://www.themoviedb.org). The Movie DB API is queried to populate the movie objects with a links to the
movie poster and a YouTube trailer. The posters are displayed on the resulting html page and clicking on any movie
will play the trailer.


To run the program:

1. In order to run the program successfully and api_key from The Movie DB is required. Steps to create this api_key
can be found at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started.

2. Once an api_key has been obtained, set the constant TMDB_API_KEY to this value in "secret.py"

3. Run the module named "main.py"

4. This will generate the "fresh_tomatoes.html" files and open it in the default browser.
